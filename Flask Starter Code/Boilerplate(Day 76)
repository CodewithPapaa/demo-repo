 # Imports the flask library
 # Starts the Flask application. The 'app' variable is very important. We'll be using that later.
 # Tells the code what to do if we've gone to our web address with just a / after the URL
 # Tells the code which webpage to show. This subroutine will display the 'Hello from Flask' page
return 'Hello from Flask!'
 # This line should ALWAYS come last. It's the line that turns on the Flask server.
