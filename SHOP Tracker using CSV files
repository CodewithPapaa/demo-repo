This Python script reads data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file named "Day54Totals.csv" and calculates the total cost by 
multiplying the "Quantity" and "Cost" values for each row in the file. Finally, it prints the calculated total in a formatted manner.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

import csv: This line imports the Python CSV module, which provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.

total = 0.0: This initializes a variable total to keep track of the cumulative total cost.

with open("Day54Totals.csv") as file:: This opens the CSV file named "Day54Totals.csv" using a with statement, which ensures that 
the file is properly closed after it's used. The file is opened in text mode by default.

reader = csv.DictReader(file): This creates a CSV reader object named reader using the DictReader class from the CSV module.
The DictReader reads each row in the CSV file as a dictionary where the keys are the column headers and the values are the
corresponding values in each row.

for row in reader:: This starts a loop that iterates through each row (dictionary) in the CSV file.

total += float(row["Quantity"]) * float(row["Cost"]): This line calculates the total cost for each row. It extracts the values 
from the "Quantity" and "Cost" columns of the current row, converts them to floats using float(), and then multiplies them together. 
The result is added to the total variable.

print(f"Total: ${round(total, 2)}"): After processing all rows, this line prints the calculated total cost. The f-string is used
to format the output, where the round() function is used to round the total to two decimal places, and the result is displayed with
a dollar sign.

In summary, this script reads data from a CSV file, performs calculations on the data, and then displays the total cost in a 
formatted way. Make sure you have a CSV file named "Day54Totals.csv" with appropriate column headers ("Quantity" and "Cost") 
for this code to work correctly.
