EXPLANATION:

Certainly! The code you provided is a Python script that schedules and sends email reminders at regular intervals using the
schedule library and the smtplib library for email communication. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

Importing Libraries:

import schedule, time, os, smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

The script begins by importing the necessary libraries:

schedule is used for scheduling tasks at specific intervals.
time is used for time-related functions.
os is used for accessing environment variables (for email credentials).
smtplib is used for sending emails.
MIMEMultipart and MIMEText are classes from the email.mime module used for constructing and formatting email messages.


Setting Email Credentials:

password = os.environ['mailPassword']
username = os.environ['mailUsername']

The script retrieves email credentials (username and password) from environment variables. 
These credentials are used to log in to the email account from which the reminders will be sent.


Defining the sendMail Function:

def sendMail():
  # ...

This function is responsible for sending email reminders. It configures the SMTP server, logs in using the provided credentials,
constructs an email message, and sends it.


Creating and Sending Email:
Inside the sendMail function, the following steps are performed:

The email content and details are defined, including the recipient's email address, subject, and message body.
The SMTP server (in this case, Gmail's SMTP server) and port are specified.
A secure connection to the SMTP server is established using TLS (starttls()).
The script logs in to the email account using the provided username and password.
An email message is constructed with the specified sender, recipient, subject, and message body.
The email is sent using the s.send_message(msg) method.


Defining the printMe Function:

def printMe():
  # ...
This function is a simple function that prints a message when called. It is used as a callback function to send an email reminder.


Scheduling Email Reminders:

schedule.every(1).hours.do(printMe)

The script uses the schedule library to schedule the printMe function to run every hour. This means that the "Sending Reminder"
message will be printed, and the sendMail function will be called at regular intervals.


Running the Scheduler:

while True:
  schedule.run_pending()
  time.sleep(1)

This loop continually checks if there are any scheduled tasks (in this case, the printMe function) to run. It runs the pending tasks
and then sleeps for one second before checking again. This loop allows the script to run indefinitely and periodically send email 
reminders.

In summary, this script sets up a scheduling mechanism to send email reminders at regular intervals, such as once every hour, 
using the schedule library. It retrieves email credentials from environment variables, establishes a connection to the SMTP server, 
and sends the email reminders when scheduled.
