First get your quotes online.

THEN,

quotes = []

# Open the file for reading
with open("quotes.txt", "r") as f:
    # Read each line in the file and append it to the quotes list
    for line in f:
        quotes.append(line.strip())  # Strip removes leading/trailing whitespace

# Now, quotes contains the lines from the file as separate elements in a list
print(quotes)


the code provided turns the quotes into a list (which is similar to an array in many programming languages).
Each line in your "quotes.txt" file is read and stored as a separate element in the list quotes


THEN THE SOLUTION

import random, os, smtplib, schedule, time
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

quotes = []
f = open("quotes.txt", "r")
quotes = eval(f.read())
f.close()



password = os.environ['mailPassword']
username = os.environ['mailUsername']

def sendMail(quote):
  quote = random.choice(quotes)
  print(quote)
  server = "smtp.gmail.com"
  port = 587
  s = smtplib.SMTP(host=server, port=port)
  s.starttls()
  s.login(username, password)

  msg = MIMEMultipart()
  msg["To"] = username
  msg["From"] = username
  msg["Subject"] = "Daily Inspiration"
  msg.attach(MIMEText(quote, 'html'))

  s.send_message(msg)
  del msg

schedule.every(24).hours.do(sendMail)

while True:
  schedule.run_pending()
  time.sleep(1)
